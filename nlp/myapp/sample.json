Very slow dropping stuff on the floor, distracted by another worker talking about payment and holidays. â€¦More Unfortunately, Google only (ice) caps its stars to 5 but you better hurry up and get here on the double (double). Donuts made espresso for you, and its (maple) bacon my heart. I'm loving this place to (Tim) bits Pretty good for a first time. They are not stingy on portion and it is worth visiting. The bacon farmer's wrap is pretty good for my breakfast. Nicely toasted! Great atmosphere ! They have a coffee bar decorated with hockey sticks. Hope they keep up their standards. Hence why the line up. Big thumbs up! I had 4 timbits, one of each they offered... I like the ones at the normal Tim hortons more, so was disappointed. Almost like they were a little stale.. â€¦More Tim Hortons is finally starting to compete w Starbucks! I would say 80% of the menu is different from the other Tims. Prices are extremely reasonable and the donuts are unique. I liked the coconut one ... it felt like there were pop rocks â€¦More Ummm it wasn't as fancy as they promotes it to be. If it wasn't for all the talk, I would've rated it higher. Looks like a normal cafe now. Meant to be a bit more chill than other Timmy's which by nature are more fast paced. â€¦More The ambiance is totally different than a normal Timmy's and the food tastes the same with a few extra goodies here. Example more donuts and sandwiches and more unique drinks. Place very busy and you can use the electronic kiosk for quicker service. Good value for money. I went shortly before noon and waited about 25 minutes. The donuts are freshly baked and they are replenished when they are sold out. I wasnâ€™t able to get all 12 flavors though as some were were still being prepared. Due to the crowds, I was told to come back later if I wanted to try the flavors I was missing. Just going to talk about how awesome the donuts are.Variety in flavour, reasonably priced. Interior atmosphere is not bad. One of a kind of Tim's in downtown.

It offers many products you won't find in a typical location such as fruit loops and maple and bacon donuts, a nitro cold â€¦More Really cool place, Tim Horton's did right by us. What kind of Tim Hortons is this. Limiting the amount of donuts one can buy.. . and not getting a steep tea right after 3 times. This is exactly what Tim Hortons needs, upgraded menu, and trendy setting. This stacks up against Starbucks and all the big chains. The donuts are amazing, and the new nitro coffee is delicious. Strongly recommend you stop by and try it out. Hopefully this expands across Canada. They have cool new offerings that are different and unique, worth a try! Slow and unfriendly staff. Poorly trained and not knowledgeable about their products. The place needs to work on its customer service if they want to achieve the fancy feel this location is going for. A fancy version of Tim Hortons - with marble tables, fux leather seating and more glamorous decor. The food choices are more limited though. The simple dounets are not available here just in caae you are looking for those. The greek yogurt â€¦More My friend and I went, they had a great selection of donuts. Coffee as usual is good. But the service was off. The staff mispelled our names and got our orders messed up. Waited 20mins for sandwich which they forgot or gave to soemone else. Ended up just replacing the orders with donuts. No apologies from the staff either. Thank goodness there was no long line when we went on a Saturday afternoon. Though prettily set up with huge display cases of beautifully decorated donuts, the new â€œinnovation cafeï¿½ was a bit of a let down for us. â€¦More Dropped in for a dark roast coffee before my meeting downtown.

No complaints here other than its a bit more expensive than other locations. â€¦More Unique selection of donuts. There is a chocolate truffle dreambit (timbit) that is to die for.

Definitely worth a visit! It's no regular Tims, and if you actually like coffee they have a full espresso bar. The coffee is waaaaaaay better than any other Tims.

Nitro Peach Mango is an Amazing Drink ï¿½ This coffee shop is just amazing, never in my life thought Tim Hortons would do something above and beyond their regular doughnuts and coffee. The drinks on the tap is the highlight for me, so is that bar area. â€¦More nice new store.. they have coffee on tap a d some new donuts I just love Tim Hortons! I thought it would be like Dukin Donuts, from US, but this is much better! I've tasted every cappuccino flavor from Tim Hortons, and I've tried to taste almost all the donuts and timbits. The breakfast meal is good too. And the price very low. Always great coffee. With a great location free od cold and snow what more could a person ask ? A total of 4 tables combined with 6 chairs and a long banquette keeps the people fresh. This is not the place for all day people watching. If these sort of locations become more common, it could make Tim Horton's relevant again. The nitro cold brew / lattes are much better than the normal Tim's coffee and â€¦More Definitely a change from normal Tim Hortons, worth a try!
